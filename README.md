# Brandon Nguyen's Hi-Lo Visualizer

Welcome!<br />
A front end BlackJack Card Counting application that utilizes an API to, generate, shuffle, and draws from a deck of playing cards. The goal is to showcase only the odds based on the card that is presented on the table. The actual game itself is still in the making

## Thoughts Before Creation / User-Planning:

> As a visitor who's interested in learning how to count cards, I want to see how my odds are calculated, as a developer, I will display text stating the current count of the counting system. </br>

</br>

> As a visitor, I want to see my total card value on each persons hand so that I don't have to count it in my head; as a developer, I will display the sum of both players card value in separate section</br>

</br>

> As a visitor, I want to be able to see a message from the developer on what he thinks I should do. I, as a developer, should display messages like a tooltip to my visitors.</br> > </br>

### MVP Goals

- Create an application that counts card for the game of black-jack to showcase odds of winning, based on hi-lo theory (Example below)

- Application responsive on mobile first

- Successfully pull API to fetch Card Deck ID and then Draw from that specific deck

- Connect components through React Router

- Be organized with components and custom hooks

- Applying everything that I learned through this section of react

<br />
